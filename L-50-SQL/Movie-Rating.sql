-- +--------------+
-- Explanation: 
-- Daniel and Monica have rated 3 movies ("Avengers", "Frozen 2" and "Joker") but Daniel is smaller lexicographically.
-- Frozen 2 and Joker have a rating average of 3.5 in February but Frozen 2 is smaller lexicographically.
 

-- Write a solution to:

-- Find the name of the user who has rated the greatest number of movies. In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller user name.
-- Find the movie name with the highest average rating in February 2020. In case of a tie, return the lexicographically smaller movie name.
-- The result format is in the following example.

-- # Write your MySQL query statement below
(SELECT name AS results
    FROM users AS u
    LEFT JOIN movierating AS mr
    ON u.user_id = mr.user_id
    GROUP BY u.user_id 
    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, name
    LIMIT 1
)
UNION ALL
(SELECT title AS results
    FROM movies AS m
    LEFT JOIN movierating AS mr
    ON m.movie_id = mr.movie_id
    WHERE month(created_at)=2 AND year(created_at)=2020
    GROUP BY m.movie_id
    ORDER BY AVG(rating) DESC, title
    LIMIT 1
)
